It's taken a better part of my night, but I've finally finished a really difficult homework problem. It feels really satisfying to have it done, especially since it's in C++, not my usual weapon of choice. I will walk through some of the finer points of the algorithm here, and you can see the whole thing [on Github](https://github.com/jrpruit1).

## Computer science graphs

Graphs are used in computer science to visualize a network of nodes with edges in between them. These nodes can be used to represent users, and the links between them could be the friendships they have. Or, the nodes could represent different lookup servers in a network. Graphs can also be used to represent cities on a map, with the edges being the roads that connect them.

One of the neat problems when given a graph with pre-defined connections and nodes is figuring out how to search through this network. Often, you need to boil down the network into a few necessary connections, that still connect everybody, but remove the overlap of redundant connections. There happen to be two different approaches to this problem, breadth-first search and depth-first search.

In our homework assignment, we had to do a breadth-first search.

## Spreading out far and wide

In a breadth-first searc, the goal is to start at one node and touch every single node adjacent to that one. Once you've figured out all of the nodes that it is attached to, you go one-by-one through those nodes and figure out what's attached to them. eventually, this will spread across the network and you will have a pretty good idea of what the network really looks like.

Here's a sample of the code, which is the bulk of the search logic:

```
while(q->getHead() != NULL) {
	q->printQueue();
	string uName = q->dequeue();
	int uIndex = listIndex(adjList, uName);
	Vertex * u = adjList[uIndex];

	Vertex * v = u->getNext();
	while(v != NULL) {
		int vIndex = listIndex(adjList,v->getName());
		if (color[vIndex].compare("white") == 0) {
			color[vIndex] = "gray";
			d[vIndex] = d[uIndex] + 1;
			pi[vIndex] = u;
			q->enqueue(v);
		}
		v = v->getNext();
	}

	color[uIndex] = "black";
}
```

It's neat that such little code can be used to traverse an entire network of nodes. For those of you who are wondering the efficiency of this algorithm, it's the same as the depth-first search algorithm, and runs at a speed bounded by the number of edges plus the number of nodes.

I will try to talk a bit more about this later, right now I need to go to sleep.
