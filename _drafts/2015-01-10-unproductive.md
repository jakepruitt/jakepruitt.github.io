description: Sometimes what we want is not what we need. This holiday break I wanted to accomplish tons of work, read up on new libraries and languages, and start new projects. Instead, I ended up being very unproductive, which was exactly what I needed.

The word "Unproductive" is a dirty word to most people. There is no greater sin than to waste time, which is so precious and important. Time is money, and unproductive time is wasteful and costly.

When I went on winter break, I planed to utilize my time to its fullest, wake up early every day to put in a few hours of work, go up to the library to read entire chapters at a time of documentation and reference manuals. I wanted a very productive vacation, without a second wasted.

What I did do was sleep in, give up on multiple obligations, lose motivation, take naps, play with my sister, watch movies with my brother, and fail to accomplish any of what I set out to accomplish. I daydreamed, I grabbed coffee with friends, I listened to music and watched snow fall. I was almost entirely unproductive.

And it was exactly what I needed.

Little Talks

I live thousands of miles from my family in Chesterton, Indiana. This break was the first time I had seen home, and my brother, in four months. When I got home, I was still in work mode, ready to work 25 hours a day, 8 days a week.

But then the after-effects of the hardest semester of my life hit me, and I denatured into a sloth.
