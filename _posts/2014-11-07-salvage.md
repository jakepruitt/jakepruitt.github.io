"Guys, I think we broke a record. We just completed 94 user stories in one sprint." My project manager looked around the room after saying this with visible relief in his smile. The quality assurance manager added, "And you had them all in before the Tuesday code freeze. I don't think anyone's ever had a sprint like this before." The lead developer and I looked at eachother and nodded, and I said, "It worked." He and I, for the first time in [LaneTerralever](http://www.laneterralever.com/)'s history, decided to rework the entire front-end development process to use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [Bower](http://bower.io/), [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/), and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). And in the matter of a two week sprint, with the help of a contractor, we were able to produce 13 pages of high-quality code, and complete 94 user stories.

We saved a project that was on the brink of cancellation, and we broke records in the process.

## A Complex Problem

I came on board this project after launching the [Honeywell Pilot Gateway App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/honeywell-pilot-gateway/id922312414?mt=8), built on [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/). My JavaScript expertise on that project earned me a promotion and the nickname "JavaScript Jake", but I was immediately tasked with living up to the title by salvaging a flailing over-budget responsive front-end project. 

I came in at the end of sprint 3, and things were not looking good. The client had already pulled the plug on another project they had contracted us for. The client also contracted a German agency to work with us to build more pages. It was very difficult to work off of the same codebase as the German team, and it felt like we were constantly at odds with their team. The lead developer for the project was a Wordpress wizard, but was trapped without much front-end tooling experience and all of the responsibility of making architecture decisions.

After six weeks of stunted work, the Germany team was working on independent code that was incompatible with our codebase. Our project was using [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) in order to support the Ruby asset pipeline that the lead developer used from a previous project. However, we were also trying to integrate a number of Grunt plugins, and attempting to work accross multiple repositories to delegate work accross the international teams. With all of these challenges and conflicting environmental configurations, at the end of sprint 3, we barely had a homepage finished.

They turned to me as the expert on Grunt and Bower, and asked me to figure out the ideal architecture for the project. I created 3 options for the project, and presented all of them to the team, the managers, and the client. When I turned it over to my boss to decide, he turned to me and said, "It's your call, Jake." It was the first time I had ever been given the responsibility of making an architecture decision, and I could not be more terrified. It was a risky client, a floundering team and an approaching deadline, and everyone was looking to me to see if I could handle it.

## Re-wiring

I decided we should go with Grunt for the entire process, switch our templating language from HAML to Jade, and move all of our global styles into a Core repository, pulling them in as a dependency through Bower. Over the course of a very rocky sprint, we made the conversion, with unforseen issues arising from grunt-compass logging issues breaking IE8 and machine-specific issues setting up fontforge. We now were at the end of sprint 4, and we barely had any pages to show for it. At this point, everyone from on high had their eyes on this project, and the only solution they saw to fix the problem was to double the size of the development team.

The lead developer and I were very scared of this happening. The project had already suffered from having too many cooks in the kitchen and not enough time to write quality code. Now, we were going to have a team of beginner programmers and a contractor who needed to be brought up to speed on the project and somehow accomplish close to 20 pages in the next two sprints. And at the end of sprint 4, we only had 2 pages.

## Pre-flight

Halfway through sprint 4, we asked the designer to not build out any more page-level photoshop files, and instead just build one comprehensive styleguide, with every single component that would be used on the pages. We would then follow the general layouts of the wire-frames from the UX team, and snap together the components to build the pages.

We set up an individual jade partial and scss file for each component, and included them all in the styleguide. Each component had its own user story, and we assigned the styleguide accross the team, each person with their designated components. We committed sprint 5 to just building out the styleguide, and I was assigned to work with the Germany team to merge as many of our styles into a core repository that could be used accross both our responsive project and their microsite project.

We hit the ground running in sprint 5 with five developers working concurrently. The lead developer closely monitored all of the pull requests and tuned all of the styles to be as modular and consistent as possible. Each component went through quality assurance before the Tuesday code freeze, and we finished every component that would be used in the site. We didn't know if this would work, but we had been forced into a position where we had no choice but to try something new. This was very different form our page-at-a-time way of doing things, and we got a lot of backlash from upper management for bringing in so many new tools and only committing to building a single styleguide for the whole sprint.

But in sprint 6, it all payed off.

## Hyperdrive

In sprint 6, we committed to finishing 13 pages, pulling in 90 individual user stories, which was one of the most aggressive sprint plans we had ever done. We knew we could handle it, since all of the components had been built and tested already, it was just a matter of composing them together in the pages. The developer team had incredible velocity, working with the other team members' components was every easy, and together with [Foundation's grid system](http://foundation.zurb.com/grid.html), we not only met our expectations by the code freeze on Tuesday, but exceeded the goal. Upper management was thrilled, the client was blown away, and the Germany team was fully onboard with our progress, already using some of our components in their projects. The development team had never seen such velocity for two and a half developers in two weeks.

At the end of sprint 6, which was today, a company-wide congratulations and thank you email was sent out by our project manager. The executive-level managers were very impressed, and we knew that this process, which we chose out of necessity, worked incredibly well. With this success story, many of the projects in the pipeline are already looking into using our model for their development process, pulling in my `Gruntfile.js` as the new company standard for projects.

## Still work to do

We still have a few bugs that need to be retraced and tuned up, so we will need one more sprint before things are finished on the responsive site. Also, we still need to figure out a way to merge the `dist` directories of both our project and the German team's project into one distribution repository, which may require setting up submodules and rethinking the way our `grunt build` task works. But we pretty much were able to turn this project around in three sprints, which is greaat not only for morale (there were no smiling faces in sprint 3), but also for the bottom line.

## If we could do it over

If I had the chance to do it over again, I would start with the core repository and build the styleguide components in there exactly like sprint 5. Then, with that repository set up to export a single stylesheet and a single minified JavaScript file, we would incorporate those into the actual website repository through [Bower](http://bower.io/). We probably would have also tried to incorporate a more component-based architecture, possibly using [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/), rather than subscribing wholesale to a library like [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/).

How would you have approached this project? I'm interested to hear your thoughts! Let me know in the comments below, or [@thejakepruitt](https://twitter.com/thejakepruitt) on Twitter.
