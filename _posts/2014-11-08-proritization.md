Here I am trying to crank out a post in a matter of minutes before going to a movie with my roommates, who I haven't hung out with all week because of homework and blog writing. I just ran back to the room from working with a fellow student on a web app, and my unread email list has increased to 53. I don't know if this pace is sustainable, and sometimes I think I can't hold up all of this.

But this is how I survive.

## The Family

I am lucky enough to have fantastic coworkers that are always looking out for my best interests. After a late night commit message, my supervisor sent me an email saying, "Go to sleep! #Avoidburnout." When I need to take break and finish some homework, they give me my space and let me crank out whatever I need. I consider them my family, and enjoy every minute I spend with them.

My roommates are also incredible, not only in holding me accountable for this blog, but for encouraging me in all of my decisions. They are the steady base that makes everything I do possible, I know plenty of people who's roommates hold them back, or discourage from the opportunities that they get.
