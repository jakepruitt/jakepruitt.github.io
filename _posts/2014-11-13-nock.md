When testing the API for [zamano-api](https://github.com/nearform/zamano-api), a small Node.js wrapper around the [Zamano](http://zamano.com/) mobile messaging platform, I ran into the problem of finding a good library to test my requests against. I needed something that would pretend to be a server for the HTTP API I was calling, and simply respond with some XML that I would parse into a JavaScript object. After looking extensively at [Sinon.JS](http://sinonjs.org/), I realized that Sinon just had too many features. I just wanted to mock an HTTP endpoint.

The best solution I found was [nock](https://github.com/pgte/nock), an HTTP mocking and expectations library by [Pedro Teixeira](https://twitter.com/pgte), the author of [Professional Node.js](http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Node-js-Building-Javascript-Scalable/dp/1118185463) (the best Node.js book I have read yet). Nock is small, has a beautiful chaining API, and has some handy sugaring.

If you want to see how I used nock, [check it out on GitHub](https://github.com/nearform/zamano-api/blob/master/test/zamano-send-messages.test.js). This article walks through my small usage.

## Nock Once, Nock Twice

The first part of setting up a URL for nock to mock is passing that URL to the `nock` function:

```JavaScript
var nock = require('nock')

var scope = nock('http://api.webservice.com')
```

Now, the next time you call `http://api.webservice.com`, the request will not go out to the actual website, but will be intercepted by nock. This will only work once though; if you try to call it more than once, the actual server will be called. To get around this, you can specify the number of times you would like nock to respond with the `times` method:

```JavaScript
var nock = require('nock')
var http = require('http')

var scope = nock('http://api.webservice.com')
	.get('/')
	.times(2)
	.reply(200, 'Ok')

http.get('http://api.webservice.com') // respond body "Ok"
http.get('http://api.webservice.com') // respond body "Ok"
http.get('http://api.webservice.com') // respond with api.webservice.com result
```

Or if we want the response to continue for all calls, we use the `persist` method:

```JavaScript
var scope = nock('http://api.webservice.com')
	.get('/')
	.persist()
	.reply(200, 'Always Ok')
```

## Reply Away

There are [a lot of options](https://github.com/pgte/nock#specifying-replies) for the way you can reply to a request with nock. The easiest way mentioned above is just with a string, but you can also reply with a JSON encoded object, or even a file:

```JavaScript
var scope = nock('http://api.webservice.com')
	.get('/withstring')
	.reply(200, 'Hello String')
	.get('/withJSON')
	.reply(200, {
		id: 1000101,
		country: 'US'
	})
	.get('/withfile')
	.reply(200, __dirname + '/testXML/success.xml')
```

Also notice in that example that we could set up multiple URLs with just one chained `nock` call. I personally think this API is super elegant and provided exactly what I needed.
