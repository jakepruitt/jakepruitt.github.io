I've had some pretty terrible group projects in school. I've also been lucky enough to have a few good group projects, especially since I've been in college. There are a lot of elements that go into making a good team. This post will talk about teamwork in the context of web projects, and provide a few of the tools that are used as teamwork becomes more difficult.

## In a perfect world

When we think of a perfect web development team, there are a few key elements that appear universally:

1. Internally motivated, talented, and competent team members
2. A small team
3. High levels of communication between team members
4. All of the team members have all of their time dedicated to the project

In the ideal world, the designer, architect and one or two developers work closely with the client to create a great website or web app. The project runs smoothly and does not need much process structure, since the team members are talented and motivated to do their best on the project.

Any project manager will look at this list and chuckle to himself or herself. It is incredibly rare that all of the planets align have all of these elements. Usually at least one of these ideals is missing, and sometimes, none of these elements exist in a project.

## Complication #1 - Limited Time

Time is a very limited resource, as this semester's course load has continuously taught me. There are often multiple projects running at once, which means that team members have to split their time between many demanding priorities. Some team members, like me, may be working part time or only be doing the project on a contract basis. Not only predictable time constraints, but also unforeseen changes in the availability of team members, like sickness or forgotten homework problems that need to be finished by noon.

In order to cope with this limited availability of core members, the core team usually needs to grow. That is where the second problem arises.

## Complication #2 - Handling a Larger team
