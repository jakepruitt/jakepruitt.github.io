Many of the most popular Node.js frameworks provide a basic structure for applications, and allow the user to create plugins or middleware that extends the basic functionality of the framework. Every framework has a variety of plugins, both official and unofficial, that create an ecosystem of users that all cooperate to not duplicate common tasks. These frameworks work more like a platform than a single product: they are the medium of communication for a variety of developers, as well as a glue that composes all of the disparate plugins into useful applications.

## Express - Concatenation

A good plugin system is characterized by clear contracts between the framework and the plugin. In Express, the middleware system is very well understood and has clear expectations about what a plugin should provide. For example, to create a plugin for Express to use, all you need to create is a function with a specific signature, and pass it into `app.use()` or any `app.VERB()`

```JavaScript
var app = express();

// a middleware with no mount path; gets executed for every request to the app
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now());
  next();
});
```

As long as `next()` is called, the request will continue through all of the other middleware in the app. It is very easy to integrate a third-party middleware, such as `cookie-parser`:

```JavaScript
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');

app.use(cookieParser());
```

The author of cookie-parser knew that his or her module only needed to return a function with the signature `function(req, res, next)` and call `next()` at the end of the function. Express is very powerful due to is strict adherence to this API: Everything is middleware in Express, from route handlers to application-wide authentication. The power of JavaScript I/O really shines in Express's API.

## Hapi - Registration

Hapi has a bit more formal approach to plugins, where each plugin is an object that needs a register function and attributes. Like Express, the register function has a clearly defined signature:

```JavaScript
var myPlugin = {
  register: function(server, options, next) {
    next();
  }
};

myPlugin.register.attributes = {
  name: 'myPlugin',
  version: '1.0.0'
};
```

This structure makes it easy for an application to be split up into separate modules, where each module defines a plugin. That way, the entire application can be defined as a set of plugins acting on the server rather than one monolithic server. If the plugins are split up into separate modules, they can easily be installed and included via Hapi's registration methods:

```JavaScript
var Hapi = require('hapi');

var server = new Hapi.Server();
server.connection({ port: 3000 });

// load multiple plugins
server.register([{register: require('myplugin')},{register: require('yourplugin')}], function (err) {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Failed to load a plugin:', err);
  }
});

server.start(function () {
  console.log('Server running at:', server.info.uri);
});
```

There are also methods for registering plugins to specific connections of a server, which allows for even more modularity.

## Seneca - Using and naming

Right now I am using [Seneca.js](http://senecajs.org/) for a checklist project. One of the beauties of Seneca is its flexibility, as can be seen on the homepage of their site. Application logic with Seneca can be created on a white board, and can be structured in almost any way imaginable. However, this flexibility has caused a bit of a difficulty for me in creating a new plugin, since example plugins and built-in plugins don't always have easily understandable API's, and it's difficult to find common conventions. For instance, in creating a quick JSON HTTP API plugin, the following code must be written:

```JavaScript
module.exports = function( options ) {
  // you need a middleware function to look for a matching URL
  this.act('role:web',{use:function(req,res,next) {
    // look for a URL
    if( 0 == req.url.indexOf('/quick') ) {
      res.writeHead(200,{
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      })
      res.end('{"data":"quick response!"}')
    }
    else next()
  }})
  // register this plugin with seneca
  return { name:'quick' }
}
```

The plugin is defined as a function that takes an `options` object and must return an object with a `name` string. Within the plugin, the web logic has to be performed with `this.act()`, which has two specific parameters of `'role:web'` and an object with only one property `use`. It is not clear why this action cannot be accomplished with an Express plugin, or how the initialization process of the plugin will occur. While the example Seneca actions have very free-flowing command signatures, the built-in plugins seem to follow a very strict convention of **role** and **cmd**.

I will be creating a Seneca.js plugin soon for Hapi, and will become very familiar with plugin infrastructure. It's difficult to reason around two simultaneous plugin systems, but I think it can be done. The trick will be to do it with a simple API with clearly defined expectations.
