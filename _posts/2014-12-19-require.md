Earlier today I had a major "Aha!" moment, the kind that you get every once in a while at random times about things you weren't thinking about. I was walking through Macy's and I thought, "Oh, so a npm module that you `require` is just a JavaScript object." Everything suddenly became much simpler and clearer to me, and server-side JavaScript, CommonJS, and npm all boiled down to plain old JavaScript objects and functions. While this is a bit of a simplification of the entire process, once I had that idea in my head, I felt curious enough to figure out how the `require` function works exactly.

## Acquiring require intelligence

The first place I usually check for things that have to do with Node core functionality is the docs. Usually once I find the docs, I read intensely for 5-10 minutes, start to space off, check my twitter, and then come back completely lost. However, this time, the documentation was very interesting and really easy to read, I suggest you check it out: [modules docs](http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html). I then try to read someone's plain English explanation of it, which can be a bit more digestible than docs. The third chapter of [Professional Node.js](http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Node-js-Building-Javascript-Scalable/dp/1118185463/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1419054220&sr=8-1&keywords=professional+node.js) does a pretty great job of this, and I was feeling pretty awesome about the ins and outs of the `require` function. One thing I learned is the following fun fact:

> **FUN FACT**: you can turn `.json` files into JavaScript objects simply by using the `require` function, e.g. `require('./locations.json')`, or even just `require('./locations');`.

After I read through both of those great resources, I decide to dig a little bit deeper. I found the [Node.js repository](https://github.com/joyent/node) on Github and started sniffing around source code for the exact implementation of the `require` function. I find this kind of source code sniffing to be the most fruitful: when you are only looking to understand one part of the system and can trace that part all the way to its roots. As I was sifting through the 1,181 instances of the `require` function being called, I had a strange thought that is big enough for the next section title:

## How does Node "require" the module that defines "require"?

Yeah, it blew my mind too. It turns out, there is a fun fact about the way Node.js defines the module system:

> **FUN FACT**: Node.js defines the module system twice, once with a minimal system for native modules and again for the general module system as a whole.

The implementation for the native module system only takes [64 lines of code!](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/src/node.js#L732) You can click that link and read through it in five minutes. The `require` method of `NativeModule` essential boils down to running `NativeModule.compile()` and returning `NativeModule.exports`. The entirety of the `NativeModule.compile()` method can be seen here:

```JavaScript
NativeModule.getSource = function(id) {
  return NativeModule._source[id];
}
NativeModule.wrap = function(script) {
  return NativeModule.wrapper[0] + script + NativeModule.wrapper[1];
};
NativeModule.wrapper = [
  '(function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) { ',
  '\n});'
];
NativeModule.prototype.compile = function() {
  var source = NativeModule.getSource(this.id);
  source = NativeModule.wrap(source);
  var fn = runInThisContext(source, { filename: this.filename });
  fn(this.exports, NativeModule.require, this, this.filename);
  this.loaded = true;
};
```

So when compiling a native module, Node looks it up in the `_source` dictionary, wraps it in a function providing `require`, `module` and `__dirname`, and then calls that function with the module's reference.

I was pretty impressed with this implementation, but I still wanted to know how the entire system worked. I kept digging until I found the `node/lib/modules.js` file, which defined the whole implementation of the CommonJS module system for Node. You can read along [here](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/module.js).

It took longer to read this file, but I did stumble upon one sneaky tidbit on [line 415](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/module.js#L415) that no one ever told me about:

```JavaScript
for (var k in global) {
  sandbox[k] = global[k];
}
```

Here's your third and final fun fact:

> **FUN FACT** Node.js has a `global` object that you can assign and re-assign values to that will persist in all of your modules. This is **VERY** frowned upon, and can lead to dangerous consequences.

I played around with the `global` object for a while, and found out just how dangerous it can be for side-effects. Specifically, if someone wanted to take advantage of the number of times you misspell `require` as `reqiure`, they could add the following code to their module and wait until you run the code with a misspelling:

```JavaScript
global.reqiure = function() {
  setInterval(function() {
    console.log('You have been hacked! Get spellcheck!');
  }, 100);
};
```

Thankfully, I found that you cannot rewrite the implementation of `require`, but I am now pretty scared of what evil-minded module writers could do by slipping in references to the `global` object in their module. This reinforces two big life lessons in the node community:

1. **LIFE LESSON #1** Never use `global`
2. **LIFE LESSON #2** Always read through the source of your third-party dependencies. Double check that they did not use `global`.

That concludes my adventure into the Node source for today. See you tomorrow!
