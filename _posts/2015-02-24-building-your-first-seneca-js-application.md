[Microservices](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) are on the rise around the world right now, with a recent [Microservices Conference](http://microxchg.io/2015/index.html) in Berlin and [new microservice meetups](http://microservicesdublin.com/) starting to gain popularity. Amazon's new service [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) provides scalable infrastructure for small event-driven services. Many languages have their own microservice implementations, including [Colossus](https://github.com/tumblr/colossus) by Tumblr written in Scala, Apache's [Zookeeper](https://github.com/apache/zookeeper) in Java, and a Node.js implementation that I've been using called [Seneca.js](http://senecajs.org/). Recently, I wrote a [Beginner's guide to Seneca.js](http://javascriptjake.com/2015/02/09/beginners-guide-to-seneca-js.html) for newcomers, which walks through the basics of what Seneca.js is and does.

This week, I'm going to walk through the basics of starting a Seneca.js project as the back-end to an Angular.js application. This guide will help get you off the ground for your first Seneca.js application, introduce you to [seneca-web](https://github.com/rjrodger/seneca-web) for creating HTTP endpoints, and interacting with Seneca's most fundamental concept, actions. You can read the final source of a Seneca.js application [on Github](https://github.com/jakepruitt/checklist) or interact with the [live demo](http://104.236.191.251/#/login).

Boilerplate
-----------

For this guide, and for my later projects, I created a [Seneca.js Yeoman generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-seneca) that can quickly scaffold out a boilerplate for a Seneca.js project from the command line. First things first, install the scaffolder **yo** and the Seneca.js scaffold **generator-seneca** from npm:

```bash
npm install -g yo generator-seneca
```

Once you have this installed, you can create a new folder for your project (e.g. `test-seneca`) and run the following command in it:

```bash
yo seneca
```

This will pull in all of your needed dependencies, including [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for easily styling front-end interfaces, [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/#), an MVC framework for client side JavaScript applications, [Hapi.js](http://hapijs.com/) as a web server framework, and [Protractor](http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/) for end-to-end functionality testing. The application structure looks like this:

```
test-seneca
|
|-- client
|   |-- css
|   |-- js
|   |-- partials
|   |-- index.html
|-- server
|   |-- api.js
|-- test
|   |-- functional
|-- bower.json
|-- package.json
|-- server.js
```

When in the root directory of the project, you can run:

```bash
npm start
```

And the Hapi.js server will start running with the single page application on port 4000 and the back-end HTTP API on port 4040. Open your browser to `http://localhost:4000/` to see the basic application:

With the server running, open a new tab and run:

```bash
npm test
```

To see protractor perform all of its functional tests on your application:

Creating an API
---------------

Now that your application is up and running, you can start building out your API! Open up the file `server/api.js` and take a look at the current API:

```JavaScript
module.exports = function(options) {
  var seneca = this,
      plugin = 'api';

  // Set top-level options for API
  options = seneca.util.deepextend({
    prefix: '/api/'
  });

  // Add all API methods
  seneca.add({ role:plugin, cmd:'test' }, test);

  // Add all necessary routes to REST API
  seneca.act('role: web', { use:{
    prefix: options.prefix,
    pin:{ role:plugin, cmd:'*' },
    map:{
      'test':{ GET:true },
    }
  }});
  
  function test(args, done) {
    done(null, {working:true});
  }
}
```

Right now, there is only one action, `{role: 'api', cmd: 'test'}` and all it does is return the JSON object `{working: true}` whenever it is called. The method is mapped to the URL `/api/test`, and when we open `http://localhost:4040/api/test` the object `{working: true}` appears.

Now, let's say you wanted to create a **ls** command that will read the current directory of the server and return the names of the files. First, you need to add the action to seneca:

```JavaScript
seneca.add({ role:plugin, cmd:'ls' }, ls);
```

Next, define the action, somewhere below the `test` definition:

```JavaScript
function ls(args, done) {
  require('fs').readdir(process.cwd(), function(err, files) {
    if (err) return done(err);

    done(null, {files: files});
  });
}
```

And then register the action with seneca-web:

```JavaScript
seneca.act('role: web', { use:{
  prefix: options.prefix,
  pin:{ role:plugin, cmd:'*' },
  map:{
    'test':{ GET:true },
    'ls':  { GET:true }
  }
}});
```

Your `api.js` file should now look like this:

```JavaScript
module.exports = function(options) {
  var seneca = this,
      plugin = 'api';
  // Set top-level options for API
  options = seneca.util.deepextend({
    prefix: '/api/'
  });

  // Add all API methods
  seneca.add({ role:plugin, cmd:'test' }, test);
  seneca.add({ role:plugin, cmd:'ls'   }, ls);
 
  // Add all necessary routes to REST API
  seneca.act('role: web', { use:{
    prefix: options.prefix,
    pin:{ role:plugin, cmd:'*' },
    map:{
      'test':{ GET:true },
      'ls':  { GET:true }
    }
  }});
 
  function test(args, done) {
    done(null, {working:true});
  }

  function ls(args, done) {
    require('fs').readdir(process.cwd(), function(err, files) {
      if (err) return done(err);

      done(null, {files: files});
      });
    }
  }
};
```

You can now run `npm start` and open your browser to `http://localhost:4040/api/ls` to see all of the files in your current directory.

Connecting from AngularJS
-------------------------

Now that you have a working back-end, it's time to create the necessary components with AngularJS to display the information. In the `client` folder, you will see all of the files organized according to Todd Motto's [Opinionated AngularJS styleguide for teams](http://toddmotto.com/opinionated-angular-js-styleguide-for-teams/), which is my personal favorite when creating an AngularJS app:

```
client
|-- css
|   |-- app.css
|-- js
|   |-- controllers
|   |   |-- HomeController.js
|   |-- services
|   |   |-- TestService.js
|   |-- app-config.js
|   |-- app.js
|-- partials
|   |-- home.html
|-- index.html
```

In order to keep resource interaction out of the controller, create a new service, called `DirectoryService.js` in the `services` folder. This service will handle all directory operations, for now it will only perform the `ls` function. In the `DirectoryService.js` file, create a function that will call `/api/ls` and return the data.

```JavaScript
// DirectoryService.js
'use strict';

function DirectoryService($http) {
  function ls(success) {
    var httpPromise = $http.get('http://localhost:4040/api/ls');Â·
    return httpPromise.success(success);
  } 

  return {
    ls: ls  
  };
}

angular
  .module('app')
  .service('DirectoryService', DirectoryService);
```

Now in the `HomeController.js` file, we can make a call to `DirectoryService.ls()` and set the scope variable `files` to the output of the API call:

```JavaScript
'use strict';

function HomeController(TestService, DirectoryService) {
  var home = this;

  home.working = false;
  home.files = [];

  TestService.success(function(data) {
    home.working = data.working;
  });

  DirectoryService.ls(function(data) {
    home.files = data.files;
  });
}

angular
  .module('app')
  .controller('HomeController', HomeController);
```

And now you have access to the files through the scope variable. In `partials/home.html` add a repeated list that lists out all of the files received from the server:

```HTML
<div class="row">
  <div class="masthead bg-primary">
    <div class="page-header">
      <h1 class="site-header">Hello!</h1>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="listing row">
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <h3>The data is: <span ng-if="!home.working">NOT </span>Working!</h3>
      <ul>
        <li ng-repeat="file in home.files">{{file}}</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

And don't forget to add the `/services/DirectoryService.js` file to the bottom of `index.html`! Very easy to forget:

```HTML
...
<script src="js/services/DirectoryService.js"></script>
...
```

Running `npm start` and opening `http://localhost:4000/` will show you this:

Next Level
----------

Now that you have defined a service and used it from back to front, you can start defining your own actions in `api.js` and map them to front-end activities! Let me know what kind of questions you have about defining actions for applications. If you want more inspiration, check out my [Checklist project](https://github.com/jakepruitt/checklist) on Github.

I am going to be working on the checklist application this week and next week to make it run across multiple processes, and stretch Seneca to its limits. Keep an eye out for future improvements to the [generator-seneca](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-seneca) scaffolding project. I will be forging ahead with more microservice best practices next week!
